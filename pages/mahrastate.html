                    The Mahra Sultanate, in full Mahra Sultanate Of Qishn And Socotra, was semi-independent state in the southern Arabian Peninsula, including the island of Socotra in the Indian Ocean. This is in now eastern Yemen. In 1886-1888, the Sultanate signed a British protectorate treaty, accepting British protection for his lands. Then later country is merged to the Aden Protectorate. The last sultan of Mahra was deposed in 1967-68, when the British vacated the region. The functional government of Mahra State printed many beautiful stamps like this on various themes. They are mainly issued for the interests of the philatelists and fund-rising. Many of these were never used for postal purpose.
