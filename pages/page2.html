        <p><b>British India</b></p>
        <p>
        The British India was the rule by the British Crown on the Indian
        subcontinent from 1858 to 1947. The rule is also called Crown rule
        in India, or direct rule in India. The region under British control 
        was commonly called India in contemporaneous usage, and included
        areas directly administered by the United Kingdom, which were 
        collectively called British India, and areas ruled by indigenous 
        rulers, but under British tutelage or paramountcy, called the 
        princely states. The region as a whole was never officially referred
        to as the Indian Empire.
