        The Indian National Army was an armed force 
        formed by Indian nationalists in 1942 in Southeast Asia during 
        World War II. Its aim was to secure Indian independence from 
        British rule. It formed an alliance with Imperial Japan 
        in the latter's campaign in the Southeast Asian theatre of WWII.

        <h5>British Guiana</h5>
        <p>
         British Guiana was a former British colony, part of the British
         West Indies, which resided on the northern coast of South America,
         now known as the independent nation of Guyana. The first European 
         to encounter Guiana was Sir Walter Raleigh, an English explorer.

        <h5>Mahara state</h5>
        <p>
          In 1886, the Sultanate became a British protectorate and later 
          joined the Aden Protectorate. The Sultanate was abolished in 1967
          upon the founding of the People's Republic of South Yemen and 
          is now part of the Republic of Yemen. The Sultanate was inhabited
          by the Mahri people who spoke the Mahri language, a modern South 
          Arabian language. The Mehri share, with their regional neighbours 
          on the island of Socotra and in Dhofar in Oman, blood lineage 
          ties in Somalia with the Darood tribe, cultural traditions 
          like a modern South Arabian language, Arabic incursions, 
          and frankincense agriculture. The region benefits from a coastal 
          climate, distinct from the surrounding desert climate, with seasons
          dominated by the khareef or monsoon.
          In 1967, with the departure of the British from the larger southern 
          Arabian region, the Aden-based South Yemeni government divided
          the Mahra region, creating the Al Mahra Governorate. Socotra 
          was administered by the Aden Governorate until 2004, 
          when it was placed under the Hadhramaut Governorate.[2]
